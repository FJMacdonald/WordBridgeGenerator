A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Call it a day
Cut somebody some slack
Cutting corners
Easy does it
Get out of hand
Get something out of your system
Get your act together
Give someone the benefit of the doubt
Go back to the drawing board
Hang in there
Hit the sack
It's not rocket science
Let someone off the hook
Make a long story short
Miss the boat
No pain, no gain
On the ball
Pull someone's leg
Pull yourself together
So far so good
Speak of the devil
That's the last straw
The best of both worlds
Time flies when you're having fun
To get bent out of shape
To make matters worse
Under the weather
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Wrap your head around something
You can say that again
Your guess is as good as mine

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A penny for your thoughts
A penny saved is a penny earned
A perfect storm
A picture is worth 1000 words
Actions speak louder than words
Add insult to injury
Barking up the wrong tree
Birds of a feather flock together
Bite off more than you can chew
Break the ice
By the skin of your teeth
Comparing apples to oranges
Costs an arm and a leg
Do something at the drop of a hat
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't cry over spilt milk
Don't give up your day job
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Every cloud has a silver lining
Get a taste of your own medicine
Give someone the cold shoulder
Go on a wild goose chase
Good things come to those who wait
He has bigger fish to fry
He's a chip off the old block
Hit the nail on the head
Ignorance is bliss
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It takes one to know one
It's a piece of cake
It's raining cats and dogs
Kill two birds with one stone
Let the cat out of the bag
Live and learn
Look before you leap
On thin ice
Once in a blue moon
Play devil's advocate
Put something on ice
Rain on someone's parade
Saving for a rainy day
Slow and steady wins the race
Spill the beans
Take a rain check
Take it with a grain of salt
The ball is in your court
The best thing since sliced bread
The devil is in the details
The early bird gets the worm
The elephant in the room
The whole nine yards
There are other fish in the sea
There's a method to his madness
There's no such thing as a free lunch
Throw caution to the wind
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't judge a book by its cover
A little learning is a dangerous thing
A snowball effect
A snowball's chance in hell
A stitch in time saves nine
A storm in a teacup
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
As right as rain
Bolt from the blue
Burn bridges
Calm before the storm
Come rain or shine
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut the mustard
Don't beat a dead horse
Every dog has his day
Familiarity breeds contempt
Fit as a fiddle
Fortune favours the bold
Get a second wind
Get wind of something
Go down in flames
Haste makes waste
Have your head in the clouds
He who laughs last laughs loudest
Hear something straight from the horse's mouth
He's not playing with a full deck
He's off his rocker
He's sitting on the fence
It is a poor workman who blames his tools
It is always darkest before the dawn
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Know which way the wind is blowing
Leave no stone unturned
Like riding a bicycle
Like two peas in a pod
Make hay while the sun shines
On cloud nine
Once bitten, twice shy
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Run like the wind
Shape up or ship out
Snowed under
That ship has sailed
The pot calling the kettle black
There are clouds on the horizon
Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
Through thick and thin
Time is money
Waste not, want not
We see eye to eye
Weather the storm
Well begun is half done
When it rains it pours
You can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs
